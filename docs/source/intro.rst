Introduction
============

This is a guide to extending the GeoNetwork Metadata Catalog to meet best practice guidance on storing and sharing metadata for both spatial and non-spatial datasets, and for improving data discoverability following `best practice guidance from the Geospatial Commission <https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/best-practice-guidance-and-tools-for-geospatial-data-managers>`__.

The objective is to provide guidance on the configuration changes and additional schema plugins that you'll need for full spatial and non-spatial data discoverability, along with a suggested workflow for metadata creators.

It's an ongoing project by Astun Technology, funded in part by a grant from the Open Data Institute.
